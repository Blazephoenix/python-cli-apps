Once upon a time, deep in an ancient jungle,
there lived a {animal.lower()}.  This {animal.lower()}
liked to eat {food.lower()}, but the jungle had
very little {food.lower()} to offer.  One day, an
explorer found the {animal.lower()} and discovered
it liked {food.lower()}.  The explorer took the
{animal.lower()} back to {city.capitalize()}, where it could
eat as much {food.lower()} as it wanted.  However,
the {animal.lower()} became homesick, so the
explorer brought it back to the jungle,
leaving a large supply of {food.lower()}.

The End
